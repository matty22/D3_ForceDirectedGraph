# D3 Force Directed Graph

The D3 force directed graph shows national contiguity (countries that share physical borders). A country that shares borders with lots of other countries will have more of an effect if you grab the flag and drag it. A country with fewer neighboring countries will have less of an effect upon drag.

## To Use

The user can drag countries around on the map to see its effect on its neighboring countries.
